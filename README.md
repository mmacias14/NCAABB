NCAA Basketball Game Predictions
I have uploaded code to produce game winner, spread, and total predictions.  The predictions are produced using using scraped team statistical data and is trained with General Additive Models (GAM).  The mainCode.R file scrapes and trains the data.  The app.R file shows the predictions in interactive tables embedded in an RShiny app.
